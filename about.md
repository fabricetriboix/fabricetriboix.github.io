My name is Fabrice Triboix. I am a software engineer, and I worked on many
roles, including software developer, team leader, release manager, and
DevOps.

I worked on a wide variety of projects, from writing interrupt
handler in assembler to python scripting, with a lot of C and C++ in
between, with a emphasis on embedded software, networking application
and Linux.
