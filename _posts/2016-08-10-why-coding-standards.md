Why should you use coding standards in your project? At a first glance,
they may look like a bureaucratic reminiscence of authoritarianism,
stifling the creativity of coders, ruining the motivation of developers!
I would actually argue that the opposite is true, provided you hire
people with the right mindset...

Creative developers sometimes like playing at the edge of the chosen
programming language, resulting in software with explosive properties.
Carefully chosen coding standards will limit dangerous code constructs
and promote defensive coding.

Some developers are eager to spend hours reducing 10 lines of code
into 1. The result would time wasted developing code difficult to test and
debug, that only the author would understand (and usually only for a few
weeks). Providing boundaries to the developers will help them focus on
solving problems directly related to the end goal (which is a working
product), and not on achieving perfect genericity or absolute elegance.

A streamlined code base makes the "look and feel" of the code uniform
across the project. Developers switching to a new component will be able
to delve into the new code and understand it quickly. This will immensly
help maintenance and on-boarding.

A previous colleague of mine who worked as a team leader once told me he
would say to his troops: "Will you be able to understand what you are
coding now in 3 months time at 2am?" If the answer is "no",
simplification is needed! Again, coding standards will help here.

A very important advantage of using coding standards is that it will
avoid most flame wars during code reviews. Too often, code reviews
descend into nasty religious fights over "my way of doing things is
better than yours", etc. By settling a lot of questions related to the
use (and abuse) of the chosen programming language, a lot of
counter-productive discussions/fights are avoided.

At the end of the day, the goal of a software project is to deliver a
software that works for the client, on time and on budget. It is not to
create a piece of art the painters of code would refine ad vitam
eternam, pursing the quest of modelling the pinnacle of code elegance.
So coming back to having developers with the "right mindset", that
essentially means people willing to accept to bend their personal
preferences for the sake of producing software that makes the client
happy. The satisfaction of such developers will come from producing,
as part of a team, high-quality software software that works for the
client. They will put aside their thirst for intricate artistry, perfect
only according to their taste.
